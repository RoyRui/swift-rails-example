h1. Rails Swift Cloud Storage Usage Demo

A simple rails application demonstrating the access of Swift File Storage from within an instance running on a cloud foundry installation.

h2. Introduction

When using cloud foundry services(mysql, postgresql, swift, ...), user credentials are provided as environment variables to the application instances.
These credentials are stored within VCAP_SERVICES. An application can parse these credentials to access the desired services.
This application demonstrates the usage scenario of accessing a Swift File Storage with the credentials provided by the cf_swift_service.

h2. Code Walkthrough

* SwiftController (app/controllers/swift_controller.rb)
** test_swift: performs the test defined in the SwiftTest class (see below)
** read_environment: prints out the environment variables visible to the application

* Swift::Storage (lib/swift/storage.rb)
** wrapper around the fog gem API
** create/delete directories on a swift instance
** upload/download/delete files from/to a swift instance

* Swift::SwiftTest
** performs the actual test (perform_test)
** generates a hash containing test outputs
** the test consists of 3 steps:
# create a test directory (create_test_directory)
# upload an example file (upload_example_file) (uploads the public/404.html as example file)
# delete the example file again (delete_example_file)


h3. Local execution

At first you have to create a tenant with the according rights on your Swift Installation.
To be able to execute the application from outside a cloud foundry installation, you have to specify the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable at startup (exchange the dummies with your credentials):

VCAP_SERVICES='{"swift-1.0":[{"name":"swift-50e83","label":"swift-1.0","plan":"free","credentials":{"name":"f757c956-cb76-4591-9c2f-ea963ae27006","authentication_uri":"https://auth.hydranodes.de:5000/v2.0/","user_name":"d0b7c1cd-7251-4e2d-a3a4-6ca09bfb1076.swift.user@a9s.eu","user_id":"2339d7937c174677a00b9a9ebccb7a99","password":"5xZgwalgILRLO75oooma","tenant_name":"f757c956-cb76-4591-9c2f-ea963ae27006.swift.tenant@a9s.eu","tenant_id":"6e6f2875c476415999ea4e151eb1f1d2","availability_zone":"nova","authentication_version":"v2"}}]}' rails s
